## JavaScript Jedi learning something new everyday

Hi there, Iâ€™m Lyane, a developer from France. I started studying web development as a self-thaught before joining [Ecole O'Clock](https://oclock.io/).
Using the vast list of resources they offer, I was able to obtain new learning skills and enjoied building responsive websites from scratch to bring new ideas to life in a browser. 
Striving to improve my skills, I then continued to improve my skills by working on self projects and learning new technologies.

Invested in a life-long learning mentality, I currently strive to join an innovative team where I could keep on growing both personally and professionally on a long-term period.

## What I am currently focusing on...
* Improving my MERN skills by building projects (currently working on my portfolio and a web application in my free time)
* Continue improving my skills in TypeScript
* Learning React Native
